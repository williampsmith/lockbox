# lockbox

## A cloud based file storage system, implemented on top of a secure cryptographic protocol for trustless server hosting.

### Part 1:

Notation -- key : value

#### keyStore
store `username : publicKey`

#### dataStore:
`random_keys = PBKDF2(password, username, 512)`

`(kh, kp, ks) = random_keys[:256], random_keys[256:384], random_keys[384:]`

`x = E~kp~(Userdata)` where `E~kp~ = block cipher encryption on key kp`

`u = HMAC(kh, username)`

store `logins/<u> : (x, MAC(x))`

TODO:
write HMAC() function that generates random IV already, etc. Makes code cleaner.


Design 1:
O(n) updates, n = number of files stored in server. Not sure how they got O(n) here??

	<user>/dir_keys  : x || SignRSA(x)			x = RSA(ke, ka)
	<user>/directory : y, MAC_ka(directory, y)	y = E_ke(r, k1, k2)
	<user>files/r	    : z, MAC_k2(r, z)			z = E_k1(contents)

		r = random ID from directory listing
		New files uploaded: generate new random r, k1, k2
			^ which is probably where O(n) comes from since have to search to make sure itâ€™s not used already

Design 2:
O(1) updates

	info/<user> : x || SignRSA(x)     			x = RSA(ke, ka, kn)
ID	<user>/r	    : y || MAC_ka(filename, y)		y = E_ke(contents)

		including filename in MAC prevents malicious server from swapping files between IDs
		E = CFB
		MAC = SHA256_HMAC
		r = ID = E_kn(filename) = SHA256_HMAC



A file ID (FID) will be generated via HMAC on the filename

And a file will be stored at some location of FID in the data store.

Something like:
userID/FID

Where userID is the HMAC on the username (to keep confidentiality).

My approach for efficient append is as follows:

FID at HMAC(filename) will contain a counter of how many appends were made for the filename
Then I can store the same file at HMAC(filename0), HMAC(filename1), etc.
